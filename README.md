This assignment can be upgraded to an official assignment with some clarification for the main function expectations. For example, are we expected to create a main function that takes in input from the user or should we statically create the main function in the image of figure 2 given in the instructions document. Additionally, we could be required to test our code with a testing suite that could either be given to us or that we create ourselves. Screenshots of desired output would also be an option to help graders verify that the code is working.
